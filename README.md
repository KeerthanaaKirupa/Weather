# weather

A new Weather Report Application with Flutter.

## Getting Started

Screens Included: 
1. Splash Screen - a small loader 
2. Choose your City - A text field with label, example and validator
3. Weather repost - Indicates the day, image corresponding to the weather, other factors like humidity, air pressure and wind speed. It also shows a preview of the weather in the next 2 days. Has a toggle in the appbar to shift from 째C to 째F and vice versa
4. The preview images are clickable and leads to a full-screen view
5. The app also has a launcher icon and name designed by the developer (me)


Future work:
1. Screen orientation - works 80% but the cool pictures are not yet done
2. Refresh button
